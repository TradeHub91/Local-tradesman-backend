# Local Trades Backend

This is the backend for your local tradesman app. It's built using Express and MongoDB.

## Setup

1. Create a `.env` file and add your MongoDB URI:

```
MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string
```

2. Install dependencies and start the server:

```
npm install
npm start
```

This app will run on port 5000 or whatever `PORT` you define.
